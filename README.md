I coded along MayanWolfe's video tutorial. Things I learned:
    1) Using '&times', '&minus', '&plus' unicode for the symbol but also for accessibility for screen readers instead of the traditional operators I probably would have utilized
    2) Was able to put into practice destructured assignment - taking a proeprty from an object and storing it in a variable
    3) Practiced a encapsulation within OOP
    4) Practiced CSS styling: transform, border-radius, flex, box-shadow
